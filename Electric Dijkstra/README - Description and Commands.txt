Hi!
This is my solution to a problem called electric dijkstra.
The problem is, given a connected, undirected graph, is it possible for an electric car with K
maximum recharges, and N range, can the car make it to each city, starting from any other city?

Main code files:
e-dijkstra.cpp
e-dijkstra.h

Please feel free to check out my solution in e-dijkstra, and if you'd like to run the provided tests,
please follow these instructions:
1) Assuming you have gcc installed that can compile c++ 17, open up a terminal in the project folder (such as typing
cmd in the file explorer path bar, while you have the folder open).
2) Compile by typing make.
3) commands:
make all -> run all tests
make short -> run all small graph tests
make long -> run all larger graph tests
make supalong -> run all gigantic graph tests
