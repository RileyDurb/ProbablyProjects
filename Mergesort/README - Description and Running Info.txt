Merge sort:
This project is my implementation of mergesort, which is an efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
Additonally, by preallocating the left and right arrays we are dividing the original array into,
we get a bit of an optimization.

Main code files:
mergesort.cpp
mergesort.h

Also, if you'd like to complile it and run the provided test, please follow these instructios.
1) Open up a command line console inside the folder (such as typing cmd into the file explorer's folder path bar,
in the upper left of the explorer)
2) Type make to compile the code
3) Type make 0 to run the mergesort with a random array.

Assuming the array is sorted correctly, it outputs OK
into a file called myout0, and outputs nothing to the console after the diff line.
