# Sample Projects
C++ Projects that I've worked on. Mainly smaller in nature, or peices of larger ones, so they are easier to review, if you are interested in seeing how I code.

For ease of navigation, please feel free to open up whatever project folder looks interesting, and then I'd reccomend checking out the README file for more project info,
a list of the main code files, and instructions for running any associated demo.
